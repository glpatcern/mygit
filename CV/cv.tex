Senior developer for the CASTOR project in the Storage group (formerly the Fabric Infrastructure and Operations, Data Management, and Data and Storage Services groups).
The project underwent a major redesign in 2004-2012, and its maturity is now key for effective and low cost operations.

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item Coordinated developments in relation to the different stakeholders, including
  operations teams, experiment representatives, grid middleware developers, and partner Tier-1
  institutes running CASTOR (CNAF in Italy, RAL in UK, and ASGC in Taiwan)
